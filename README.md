## Music Menu Mod
**Final Burn Mango**: a music mod/app for X-men vs SF, MVC 1/2, BB, Simpsons, and may work on other cabs with Operating Systems that are Android version 7 to 10-based.

*Note: there is no more need for a 5-second wait for XVS or MVC on this app as described in Software Modding 1/2 vids*

## Input Drivers
**Final Burn Delta**
*Note: originated as the community mod long before anyone thought to do this -- developed to play more competitively and evolved, and at some point some officially made their way to XVS/MVC/MVC2.*

*Still relevant to update Big Blue, Yoga or Shinkuu SF2 cabs since they are still despite other community mods the most efficient way to play online with stock and used by competitive SF2 community. It does not cover 2-4P on RetroArch, since it is aimed at improving stock experience otherwise there would have been a perf hit despite it not being mentioned or measured anywhere else that shares these. But you should use the one most appropriate for what you want to do (i.e. either fix performance for online play or improve it slightly and play RetroArch, YMMV).*

[Download Latest Driver](https://github.com/thecodealwayswins/xvs-mvc-bb-a1up/raw/main/drivers/tcaw-fbd-bigblue-xvs-mvc-driver.zip)

*Note: running the script in the above in Xmen v SF/MVC/BB will remove the need for a 5-second wait on your PC; this was not covered in 1st two vids as I sorted that out later. But beyond that no need for XVS/MVC input drivers since these come with the cab thanks to Arcade1Up working with myself and the community.*

[Download Latest Driver](https://github.com/thecodealwayswins/xvs-mvc-bb-a1up/raw/main/drivers/tcaw-fbd-shinkuu-yoga-v1.0.1a.zip)

*Note: installing the above in Xmen v SF/MVC/BB will remove the need for a 5-second wait (not covered in vids) on your PC. But beyond that no need for XVS/MVC input drivers since these come with the cab thanks to Arcade1Up working with myself and the community.*

## General Modding Tutorials

*Note: Google USB Driver and Android SDK Tools no longer needed for the newer driver or app releases, neither is 5-second wait since they take care of that. But left these tutorials up for people who want general access to tools on their PC that are not installing already-created mods*
